# File Compressor

File Compressor is a program for losslessly compressing/decompressing text files.

## Description

File Compressor is a program that is capable of losslessly compressing text files into binary .hcz files and then decompressing those
back to the original text file without any differences. It does this using 3 different flags, -b for build codebook for text file
using Huffman coding, -c for compress text file into .hcz file using codebook, and -d for decompress .hcz file into text file using
codebook. Building a codebook uses a hashmap to measure token frequencies, and then a min heap to build a Huffman tree that contains
binary codes for each token. Additionally, these commands can be applied recursively to a directory by appending the -R flag: then the
command is applied to every text file found in the directory as well as the text files within directories found in the directory. Note
that recursively building a codebook produces one codebook that includes the tokens for all the text files and text files in
directories within the directory.

## Usage

```bash
./fileCompressor <flag(s)> <path or file> |codebook|
./fileCompressor -b someFile
./fileCompressor -c someFile someCodebook
./fileCompressor -d someFile.hcz someCodebook
./fileCompressor -R -b someDirectory
./fileCompressor -R -c someDirectory someCodebook
./fileCompressor -R -d someDirectory someCodebook
```

## Complexity

Let n be the number of tokens found. Let m be the number of unique tokens. We will analyze the time and space complexities for each
of the 3 basic commands.
